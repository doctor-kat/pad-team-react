## Purpose
pad-team-react is a tool to provide an interface to easily search for particular monsters.  Current in-game solutions only provide sorting and filtering by properties, but it is not capable of complex search criteria.  This tool connects to [PADHerder's API](https://www.padherder.com/api/) always provide up-to-date data.  pad-team-react is intended to be a refactor of the interface to [pad-team-builder](https://github.com/naisho/pad-team-builder), which suffers from performance issues during page load.

## How to run
pad-team-react was created with create-react-app with little modification.
- run `npm install` to install all dependencies
- run `npm start` to start the dev server
